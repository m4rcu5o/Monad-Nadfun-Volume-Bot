# 🔥 Monad Nadfun Volume Bot — High-Performance Monad Volume Bot for Automated Liquidity & Trading Activity

A powerful, production-ready **Monad Volume Bot** built for generating realistic buy/sell activity, rotating liquidity, and simulating natural trading patterns on **Nadfun tokens** deployed on the Monad ecosystem.  

This bot uses distributed wallets, randomized execution timing, controlled slippage, and continuous swap loops to mimic organic market volume — ideal for token bootstrapping, liquidity testing, or stress-testing Nadfun deployments.

### ⚡ Multi-Wallet Parallel Volume
Generate continuous volume using up to **20 parallel wallets**, each performing randomized buy & sell cycles.

### 🤖 Automated Buy/Sell Rotation
Each wallet:
- Buys Nadfun token using % of its balance  
- Waits a random interval  
- Sells token  
- Loops endlessly  

This simulates realistic, human-like trading activity.

### 💸 Automatic Fund Distribution
The bot automatically:
- Distributes MONAD (or test token) from the main wallet  
- Funds distributed wallets  
- Collects all remaining balances back to the main wallet

### 🎯 Configurable Slippage + Strategy
Full control over:
- Buy/Sell thresholds  
- Delay windows  
- Slippage tolerance  
- Wallet count  

### 🔄 Continuous On-Chain Swaps
The bot interacts directly with Nadfun swap contracts to generate real on-chain activity.
